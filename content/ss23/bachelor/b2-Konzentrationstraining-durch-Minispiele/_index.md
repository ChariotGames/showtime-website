{{<section title="Our Goal">}}
Our goal is to challenge and by that promote concentration.

Parallel mini-games in the areas of memory, reaction, cognition and rhythm are designed to challenge the player at different levels of difficulty. 

The mini-games are deliberately designed to simulate the simplest tasks in combination. 

It sounds easier than it is, so come to our booth and test it and your concentration yourself.

We are a team of 7 IMI students with different experiences and skills in project management and app development. 

We have dynamically divided the tasks according to ability and interest, so that everyone has the opportunity to develop in their respective field.
